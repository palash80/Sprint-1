## Bit bucket Application Template

### INTRODUCTION

 BitBucket is a cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control the changes to their code. BitBucket provides a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Its interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. We generally require a bit more technical knowledge and use of the command line to use Git alone. Additionally, BitBuckets provides a variety of services like it gives teams to collaborate and create projects, test and deploy the code.
